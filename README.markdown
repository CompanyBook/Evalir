What is Evalir?
===============
Evalir is a library for evalution of IR systems. It incorporates a number of standard measurements, from the basic precision and recall, to single value summaries such as NDCG and MAP.

For a good reference on the theory behind this, please check out Manning, Raghavan & Sch√ºtzes excellent [Introduction to Information Retrieval, ch.8](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/evaluation-in-information-retrieval-1.html).
