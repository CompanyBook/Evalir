What is Evalir?
===============
Evalir is a library for evalution of IR systems. It incorporates a number of standard measurements, from the basic precision and recall, to single value summaries such as NDCG and MAP.

For a good reference on the theory behind this, please check out Manning, Raghavan & SchÃ¼tzes excellent [Introduction to Information Retrieval, ch.8](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/evaluation-in-information-retrieval-1.html).

What can Evalir do?
-------------------
* Precision
* Recall
* Precision at Recall (e.g. Precision at 20%)
* F-measure
* R-Precision

How does Evalir work?
---------------------
The goal of an Information Retrieval system is to provide the user with relevant information -- relevant w.r.t. the user's *information need*. For example, an information need might be:
> Information on whether drinking red wine is more effective at reducing your risk of heart attacks than white wine.
However, this is *not* the query. A user will try to encode her need like a query, for instance:
> red white wine reducing "heart attack"
To evaluate an IR system with Evalir, we will need human-annotated test data, each data point consisting of the following:
* An explicit information need
* A query
* A list of documents that are relevant w.r.t. the information need (*not* the query)
